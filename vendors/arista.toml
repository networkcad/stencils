    # The Arista 7050SX3-48YC12 is a 1RU system with 48 ports of 25GbE
    # SFP and 12 ports of 100GbE QSFP with an overall throughput of
    # 4.8Tbps. The high density SFP ports can be configured in groups
    # of 4 to run either at 25G or a mix of 10G/1G speeds. The QSFP
    # ports allow for a choice of 5 speeds including 100GbE, 40GbE,
    # 4x10GbE, 4x25GbE or 2x 50GbE with a wide choice of transceivers
    # and cables enabling a choice of combinations for both leaf and
    # spine deployment. With low latency and no oversubscription, the
    # switch is optimized for high performance server and storage
    # deployments.
